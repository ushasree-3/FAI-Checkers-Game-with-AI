## **Project Overview**

This project is a Python implementation of the classic board game **Checkers** using the `pygame` module. It features:  

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against another player locally. 
- **Human vs AI Mode**: Challenge an AI opponent. 

The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to optimize decision-making and includes an **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy** for introducing variability in its moves.

## **How to Play**

### **Launching the Game**
1. Run the script.
2. Select the desired game mode from the menu:
    -   Two-Player Mode
    -   Human vs AI Mode

### **Controls**
- Use the **mouse** to select and move pieces.  
- Valid moves will be **highlighted on the board**.  
- Pieces can capture opponent pieces by **jumping over them diagonally** to an empty square.  
- **Regular pieces** move diagonally forward, while **Kings** can move diagonally forward and backward.  
- **Kings** are created when a piece reaches the opponentâ€™s back row.  
- Multiple captures in one turn are allowed if conditions permit.

## **Objective**

The objective of the game is to:  
- **Capture all of your opponent's pieces**, or  
- **Block all possible moves** of your opponent.  

## **Customization**

- **AI Depth**: Modify the depth of the Minimax tree in `game.py` to control the difficulty level of the AI.  
- **Epsilon Value**: Adjust the `epsilon` parameter in `game.py` to control the randomness of the AIâ€™s moves.

### **Enjoy playing Checkers!** ðŸŽ®
